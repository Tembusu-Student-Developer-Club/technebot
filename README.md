# Project TechneBot

This bot was conceptualised by the Techne IG, in Tembusu Residential College, in order to encapsulate some of the processes at the Tembusu College MakerSpace into a single, handy telegram bot. The bot was named "TechneBot" as the first official project started by the Techne EXCO of AY21/22.

The bot currently has a few basic functionalities that provide users with:

- List of available commands, using the command `/help`.
- MakerSpace rules and regulations, using the command `/rules`.
- Techne EXCO contacts (telegram handles), using the command `/contacts`.
- Google Drive link to Techne's archive of educational resources, using the command `/resources`.

## Project Status

There are two major features that will be implemented soon:

1. Booking of MakerSpace equipment

Using this bot, heavy equipments like the 3D printers or the drill presses in MakerSpace can be booked in advance, reducing possible conflicts. The booking slots will be publicly visible to all who are licensed to use the MakerSpace equipments, making the booking process much more streamlined.

The command /book is used to access this feature.

2. Loaning of MakerSpace equipment

Using this bot, students can borrow equipments from the MakerSpace easily, without the hassle of having to contact the Techne EXCO members. The bot will tell you the quantity of each equipment currently in the MakerSpace available for loaning, and students can indicate the loan period accordingly. The bot will automatically fill out the loan form and send to the MakerSpace Head and other Techne EXCO members; the student will be informed in the case that the loan is not possible for whatever reason.

The command /loan is used to access this feature, and the command /checkloan can be used to check the loan status.

## Installation & Development

Users can run `main.py` script from their local machines (connected to the internet) to activate the bot.

## Activation

Users can start using the bot by finding the bot on telegram with @Techne0_bot, or using this link:
https://t.me/Techne0_bot

Afterwards, a simple /start command will begin the bot to start communicating with the user.

## Credits

This project is currently being worked on under the Tembusu Student Developer Club (SDC).
